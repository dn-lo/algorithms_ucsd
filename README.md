This repo contains the code I developed to solve the assignments for the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization offered by the University of California San Diego on Corusera.

**Please notice:** the code developed for this course is not divided into modules, where each function has its separate header files and library. In fact, each assignment has to be submitted as a single .cpp file.

Therefore, unfortunately you'll see a lot of repeated code. Hope you will enjoy it anyways!
